Node js is not a language, certainly not a technology,
not a framework, not a library, it is javascript runtime
environment. 
During the start, We cannot create backend using javascript because javascript
does have the functionality required for backend.
Then came Ryan Dahl who thought  that js should be used for
backend. The google chrome v8 engine source code is open source
and Ryan Dahl is trying to use that code to make backend using js.
Then he thought that we need to code in js. 
Ryan Dahl wrapped the V8 engine code(C++) with js code. 
We will write js code which will recieve wrapper layer js code and that code
will create a server with the V8 engine c++ module. This whole
V8 engine source code being wrapped by js is Nodejs.

Node js is a js runtime environment. We can create server using
node js.

npm => it is a library where we can find already developed modules
ready for use.
npm init => package.json
