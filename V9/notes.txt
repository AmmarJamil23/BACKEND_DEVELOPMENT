authentication and authorization

=> before giving a profile to user we have to check who is the user. this is called authentication means to validate user.

=> authorized to perform some tasks which are only allowed to be executed by the administrator. It performs that which operation can a user perform and which they cannot perform.

server forgets everytime who you are so the server forgets who you are so to perform eevery task the server will aks you who you are.
cookie and sessions come to to solve this.

cookie purpose is to store data on the browser from the server.

In Node.js with Express.js, a cookie is a small piece of data stored in the user's browser and sent back to the server with every request. Cookies are mainly used for:

Session management (e.g., login authentication, remembering a logged-in user).

Personalization (e.g., storing user preferences, theme settings).

Tracking (e.g., analytics, user behavior).

How cookies work

Server sets a cookie: The server sends a Set-Cookie header in the HTTP response.

Browser stores it: The clientâ€™s browser saves the cookie.

Browser sends cookie back: On each request to the same domain, the browser includes the cookie in the request headers (Cookie header).

Server reads it: The server can read the cookie value and use it.

=>  first we have to learn some things 
1 - how to set cookies.
2 - how to use bcrypt for passwords encryption and decryption
3 - what is JWT and how to store data in JWT and use it.
