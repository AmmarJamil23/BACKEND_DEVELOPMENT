What is a middleware?
=> It is a function that runs between the incoming HTTP request and
final route logic.
It us a checkpoint or filter that can: 
1- Read or modify the request(req)
2- Add new properties to It
3- Stop the request for example for authentication.
4- or allow it to continue to the next step(next())
It sits in the middle of the request-response flow.

app.use()
=> This is a method to load any middleware in express
syntax => app.use(myCustomMiddleware)

express.json()
=> It loads express built-in middleware that parses incoming
JSON data from the request body.
SO when we send data like: 
{
    "name": "abc",
    "hobby": "cricket"
}
in thunder client post method. express.json() reads it, converts
it into a Javascript object, and attaches it to req.body. SO
inside out route we can do this:
console.log(req.body.name)
Without it req.body will be undefined.
