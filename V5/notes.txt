To handle backend process of forms and making sure the data
coming from any frontend lib, fw, templating engines, we still
handdle it in the backend.


session cookie:

we can place any data on the frontend or browser . if we do
request backend then that saved data will go to the backend
automatically. We use it mainly for login authentication and 
keep the user login even if they go on our application after
some time. the time between login and logout is called a 
session.



blob is unreadable stream
we send plain text but the server recieved blob which is not directly readable
now we have to handle that we can make that blob readable
